## FLYRE app

### General Assembly Project 2

## Concept (unless I pivot):

Connect DJs(& artists) with clubs/parties/promoters etc


### User stories:

As a DJ I want to promote myself to party organisers so that they can find me, hear my music and book me

As a party/club/festival organiser I want to be able to easily search out DJs, find their music, genre, location, prices etc and contact them so that I can run a successful event

### Optional extra concept:
(DJs slash artists?)

To define ‘artists’ scope (bands/performers etc) - focus on DJs for now?
